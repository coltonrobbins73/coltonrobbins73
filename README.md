‚Ä¢	Reduced processing time for gene expression data sets from 2 hours down to 5 minutes through automated data pipelines using Python and R. 
‚Ä¢	Visualized real-time complex experimental data using interactive dashboards fed from 3 disparate SQL database sources connected to Tableau.
‚Ä¢	Automated large dataset processing with AWS cloud computing in conjunction with workflow management software to achieve efficient and scalable data analysis.
‚Ä¢	Presented technical research findings in over 40 weekly meetings and led discussions in 3 departmental meetings.
‚Ä¢	Successfully managed 5 concurrent projects within a 6-month period, achieving a 100% completion rate.

### NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA
**Research Associate III**  
(December 2021 - November 2022)
‚Ä¢	Reduced assay failure response time by 25% through the development and deployment of a cloud-based SQL database for real-time quality control monitoring and anomaly detection.
‚Ä¢	Accelerated time-to-insight by 70% and reduced human error by 10% through the engineering of end-to-end automated data analysis pipelines.
‚Ä¢	Increased sensitivity and specificity of spatial molecular assays by 20% through rigorous statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests, regression modeling).
‚Ä¢	Successfully developed and validated a novel spatial biology prototype, exceeding target performance metrics by 12% and accelerating the product's path to commercialization.
‚Ä¢	Translated complex biological questions into actionable data analysis plans through effective collaboration with a team of 15+ biologists, engineers, chemists, and software developers.
