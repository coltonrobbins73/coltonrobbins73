# Work Experience

## Data Analyst ‚Äì Fred Hutch Cancer Research, Seattle, WA
**Mar 2023 ‚Äì Jan 2024**

*Skills:* ***SQL, Python, PostgreSQL, Machine Learning, Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Cloud Computing***

- Attained a 20% improvement in cell-type classification by implementing deep language models (scBERT transformer) on large-scale biological datasets (500+ million data points).
- Reduced processing time by 95% for RNA expression analysis through Python automation scripts, Slurm job scheduler, and workflow management software on high-performance computing clusters.
- Led 30 weekly meetings and 3 departmental meetings to discuss technical research findings and future directions using Tableau, Looker, and plotly visualizations.
- Saved $$80k annually by automating end-to-end single-cell analysis pipeline using the scverse anndata toolkit executed on a 600GB memory high-performance computing cluster.
- Achieved 100% completion rate for 5 concurrent projects within a 6-month period.

## Research Data Specialist - Nanostring Technologies, Seattle WA
**Dec 2021 ‚Äì Nov 2022**

*Skills:* ***SQL, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, OpenCV), MySQL, Tableau, ANOVA, Regression, Causal Inference***

- Achieved 25% reduction in assay failure response time through the development and deployment of a cloud-based SQL database for real-time quality control monitoring and anomaly detection.
- Accelerated time-to-insight by 70% through the development of Python-based automated data analysis pipelines leveraging pandas, scikit-learn, and Tableau visualization.
- Realized a 20% increase in sensitivity and specificity for spatial molecular assays through rigorous statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests, regression modeling) of spatial biology performance metrics.
- Automated analysis of 100+ terabytes of spatial microscopy images to directly quantify improvements to key protocol changes reducing product iteration intervals by 1-week on average; an estimated savings of 100k per year.
- Effectively translated $$500k budget for spatial biology prototype to first phase product delivery 6-weeks ahead of schedule while surpassing molecular detection efficiency requirements of 80%.

## Computational Biologist ‚Äì Washington State University, Pullman WA
**Sep 2018 ‚Äì Aug 2021**

*Skills:* ***Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), R (Bioconducter, Ggplot2, Tidyverse), Regression, Hypothesis Testing***

- Achieved a 20% improvement in cell-type classification on large multi-species multi-temporal single-cell data sets (e.g., 700+ million data points across 3 species across 15 time points).
- Reduced processing time by 40% for immunofluorescent cell counting by authoring automated image analysis software using ImageJ macros, R scripting, and Bioconducter packages.
- Saved ~$2000 quarterly on lab reagents by integrating an online ordering database with direct vendor purchasing.
- Automated analysis on 200 core computing cluster to quickly align genomic sequencing fragments (300 GB memory).
- Trained and mentored 7 lab technicians in advanced laboratory protocols and computational methods.
